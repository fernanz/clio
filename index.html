                 <h3>Built on the JAMstack</h3>
                 <p>Netlify CMS is based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs and prebuilt Markup. Compared to server-side CMS like WordPress, this means better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. You can learn more about the JAMstack on <a href="https://jamstack.org">jamstack.org</a>.</p>
